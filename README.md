## Professional work on GitHub

I use the handle [@jputrino](https://github.com/jputrino) for my professional work here in GitHub. A lot of my work has been in private repos, either here or in GitLab.  
Here is a selection of publicly available projects that I've developed or contributed to:

- [nginx-hugo-theme](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-hugo-theme/commits/main/?author=jputrino)
- [f5-sphinx-theme](https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-sphinx-theme/commits/master/?author=jputrino)
- [f5-openstack-docs](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-openstack-docs/commits/master/?author=jputrino)
- [f5-ci-docs](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-ci-docs/commits/master/?author=jputrino)

## Writing Samples

### [NGINX Controller documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-controller)

I worked with another Technical Writer to revamp the NGINX Controller product documentation from a single Markdown file to a content set that leveraged many of the principles of DITA in a docs-as-code framework. The documentation for this product was originally available only in the product user interface. Because the documentation shipped with the product, we decided to follow the same organization model as the user interface. The underlying assumption here was that doing so would make it easier for users to find information about the specific product area(s) they were currently using. The following are examples from this content set to which I made significant contributions and/or wrote the original versions.

- [Forward Analytics Data to Datadog](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-controller/analytics/forwarders/forward-analytics-to-datadog/)
- [Troubleshoot Data Forwarders](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-controller/support/troubleshooting-forwarders/)
- [Trial NGINX Controller with App Security](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-controller/admin-guides/install/try-nginx-controller-app-sec/)

### [F5 OpenStack Solutions](https://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/openstack/)

I worked with Product Managers, Engineers, and Solutions Architects to create the documentation (including the graphics) for the [F5 OpenStack Solutions](https://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/openstack/) from the ground up. This open-source content set was one of F5's first forays into both open-source development and the public cloud space. The following are a few representative examples from this documentation set.

- [F5 Driver for OpenStack LBaaS](https://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/openstack/v1/lbaas/)
- [F5 Agent Modes of Operation](https://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/openstack/v1/lbaas/f5-agent-modes.html)
- [Manage shared network resources from any tenant](https://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/openstack/v1/lbaas/manage-common-net-objects.html)

### Open-source projects

I've made a few contributions to other open-source projects' documentation, mostly due to participation in Writing Day at the annual Write the Docs North America conference. A few examples of this work include:

- [Kubernetes docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/commits/main/?author=jputrino)
- [Write the Docs](https://github.com/writethedocs/www/commits/main/?author=jputrino)
